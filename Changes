	+ get_styntax() has returned to take syntax from text grammar files from 
	  either EditPlus or UltraEdit. These custom grammars will override any
	  built-in support for the language specified.
	- import method dropped, as the loaded grammar hash is now only for custom
	  grammars loaded with get_syntax, which cannot be run at import time
	+ Added 'options' parameter to highlight() that will be passed on to the 
	  package's highlight method for any custom configuration
	! All public methods can take a hash parameter list in addition to a 
	  simple flat list.
	! Bad parameters to configure now cluck with an error instead of just ignored
	! Updated forum default settings
	! Filled out an initial chunk of the POD
	! Added a default syntax hash to T::H::HTML and changed the structure of 
	  the reparsing.
	! Altered HTML test to work without external modules

	+ Added import method to T::H in order to preload all bundled grammars with

	! dropped the get_syntax method, going to make a stand-alone script to
	  generate the Text::Highlight:: sub-modules
	+ wrote Text::Highlight::HTML as a wrapper around HTML::SyntaxHighlighter,
	  which is now a prerequisite module
	+ bundled languages now include C++, CSS, HTML, Java, Perl, PHP, and SQL
	+ added a short hello-world-ish test for each bundled language
	! other small changes (this early in the module's life, there's bound to be
	  plenty)
